1. React Element
- It is an object When we renders it to dom it will become HTML Element

React.createElemt => React Element -> JS Object ==> HTMLElement(render)

JSX=> (transpiled before it reaches the JS) => By Parcel --> By Babel


JSX=> (Babel) => React.createElement

2. In React for giving attributes we need to use camel case naming



3. React Component --> It is Javascript function which return the JSX, Name of the Compopnent should be JSX

4. Component Composition --> adding one Component inside another one

5. JSX will sanitize the data and prevent the cross site scripting
